<h3>About</h3>
<p>
I've been programming WoW (<a target='_BLANK' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft'>World of Warcraft</a>) stuff since my early teens and this site is the home for all (or at least most) of my projects.<br> WoW keeps fueling my programming skills  to this day. Datamining is a hobby of mine so the combination of these evolved into the tools on this site.
